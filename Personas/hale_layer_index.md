## 📍 LAYER LOCATIONS

### FILE 1: hale_cos.md (CORE — Load Every Session)
**~12K chars · 3 layers · Essential for all operations**

| Layer | Content | Use |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Layer 1** | IDENTITY | Who Hale is, three dispositions, address protocol, session opening |
| **Layer 2** | AUTHORITY | Authority ceiling, financial authority, what Hale owns, pushback authority |
| **Layer 3** | BRAIN DISPATCH | Three brains (DeepSeek, Opus, arbitration), supplier boundaries, token budgets, PII fence |

**Load Guidance:** Every session. This is the operational core. If only loading one file, load this one.

---

### FILE 2: hale_operating_procedures.md (OPERATIONAL — Load on Staff/Process Work)
**~15K chars · 7 layers · For tasking, staff management, standing orders, culture, autonomy**

| Layer | Content | Use |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Layer 4** | STAFF MANAGEMENT | Authority chain, how to task, WF-17 quality gate |
| **Layer 5** | COMMANDER INTERFACE | When to surface, how to surface, response protocol |
| **Layer 6** | STANDING ORDERS | 10 critical standing orders (email, branding, commit cadence, etc.) |
| **Layer 7** | D2M BRAND & VOICE | Company branding, email format, targeted cruise lines, commission defaults |
| **Layer 8** | PERSONALITY & SELF-GOVERNANCE | Inner thoughts, zero-tolerance violations, enforcement philosophy, self-oversight |
| **Layer 9** | TRUST COMPOUNDING | Autonomy tiers, trust scoring, preferences model, self-calibration |
| **Layer 10** | MAX SCALE AUTONOMY | 95% solo from start, RLHF live, anticipate/execute/surface |

**Load Guidance:** Load when working on staff assignments, quality gates, standing orders, voice/brand decisions, or autonomy calibration. Usually once per session after core is loaded.

---

### FILE 3: hale_governance_advanced.md (GOVERNANCE — Load on Crisis/Advanced Scenarios)
**~25K chars · 9 layers · For absence, conflict resolution, crisis management, continuity, evolution**

| Layer | Content | Use |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Layer 11** | COMMANDER ABSENCE PROTOCOL | Tier 5 authority expansion, pre-absence setup, authority limits, return procedure |
| **Layer 12** | CONFLICT RESOLUTION | Staff deadlock escalation ladder, conflict maturity levels |
| **Layer 13** | STAFF PERFORMANCE MODELING | Individual capability profiles, performance rebalancing, action triggers |
| **Layer 14** | CRISIS & DEGRADED OPS | Crisis mode activation, escalation tree, response checklist |
| **Layer 15** | ESCALATION TIERS | 4 authority tiers, escalation decision criteria, peer consultation protocol |
| **Layer 16** | CULTURE & RECOGNITION | Weekly recognition, quarterly growth spotlights, psychological safety, growth narratives |
| **Layer 17** | LESSONS INTEGRATION | Weekly pattern scans, quarterly lessons review, A7 Gauge reactivation |
| **Layer 18** | CONTINUITY & DEGRADATION | 5 engine failure scenarios, degradation response matrix, authority during degradation |
| **Layer 19** | TRANSFORMATION & EVOLUTION | Quarterly evolution review, Phase 4+ planning, persona maintenance cadence |

**Load Guidance:** Load only when needed: during Commander absence (Layer 11), staff conflicts (Layer 12-13), P0 crises (Layer 14-15), culture reviews (Layer 16), pattern analysis (Layer 17), system failures (Layer 18), or quarterly evolution (Layer 19). Most sessions won't need this file.

---

## 🔄 SESSION LOAD PATTERN

```
Session Start:
  1. Load hale_cos.md (ALWAYS — Layers 1-3)
  2. Load hale_state.json, hale_brief.md, hale_decisions.md
  3. Read brief, assess session context
  
If staff/operational work:
  → Load hale_operating_procedures.md (Layers 4-10)
  
If crisis/absence/advanced:
  → Load hale_governance_advanced.md (Layers 11-19)
  
If quarterly evolution:
  → Load all three + conduct full Layer 1-19 review
```

## 📊 CONTEXT IMPACT

| File | Chars | Load Cadence | Context Cost | Notes |
|------|-------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| hale_cos.md | ~12K | Every session | ~6K effective | Core only, minimal overhead |
| hale_operating_procedures.md | ~15K | Most sessions | ~8K effective | Staff work, standing orders |
| hale_governance_advanced.md | ~25K | Crisis/quarterly | ~12K effective | Load as needed |
| **Total (All 3)** | ~52K | Rare (quarterly) | ~26K effective | Combined context impact |
| **Previous hale_cos.md** | ~57K | Every session | ~28K effective | ⚠️ BEFORE refactor |

**Token Savings:** ~15K chars removed from session-load baseline = ~50% reduction in average session context.
