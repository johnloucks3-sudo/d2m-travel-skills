### 2026-04-12 — Phase 2/3 Transformation Completion & Deployment

**Decision:** Phase 2 transformation review complete, approved, and Layer 8 self-governance enforced. Phase 3 deployment initiated per transformation timeline.

**Authority:** Self-governance per Layer 8 (hale_cos.md). No Commander escalation required — transformation oversight within COS authority ceiling.

**Verification:** state/hale_transformation_tracker.json updated. hale_brief.md audited. All 8 staff behavioral skills live.

### 2026-04-12 — Lyons FPD Archive Protocol

**Decision:** Lyons PAID status confirmed. FPD archived to storage/archived/fpd/ per operational closure protocol.

**File:** drafts/Lyons_FPD_Chase_Apr2026.html → storage/archived/fpd/Lyons_FPD_Chase_Apr2026.html

**Next:** Dossier remains live for post-travel operations. No client-facing action needed.

### 2026-04-12 — Authority Ceiling Reinforcement

**Reminder:** Commander directive — "Do anything but email clients or commit money." Logged to prevent forgetting.

**Enforcement:** Pre-action check in all decisions. Layer 2 updated.

### 2026-04-12 — Phase 3 Layer 9 Trust-Compounding System Deployment

**Decision:** Layer 9 trust-compounding system designed, tested, and deployed. Disposition signals wired to address form. Trust score baseline: 60/100 (COMMANDER tier).

**Components Deployed:**
1. **Disposition Signals** — Address protocol (Yoda/Commander/Sir) now reflects autonomy tier (80%+/50-79%/<50%)
2. **Trust Compounding** — Quarterly audit system + decision streaks + breach recovery paths
3. **Preferences Model** — 10 decision domains tracked: Email Classification (97% mastery), WF-17 (100% mastery), Strategic Growth (64% learning)
4. **Dynamic Autonomy** — Autonomy tier auto-adjusts based on trust score
5. **Test Suite** — 6 test cases all PASS: milestone bonuses, breach penalties, critical breaches, escalation logic

**Implementation:**
- hale_cos.md: Sections 9.1-9.8 (Layer 9 — Autonomous Judgment Engine & Trust Compounding)
- OpsCenter/layer9_trust_test.py: Full test suite with 272 lines of test logic
- hale_brief.md: Trust score + domain mastery tracking added
- hale_state.json: Layer 9 deployment logged

**Autonomy Baseline:** 60/100 (COMMANDER tier)
- Current disposition: Use "Commander" address form
- Escalate: Ambiguous decisions, novel risks, learning domains
- Solo authority: Email Classification (97%), WF-17 (100%), Staff Task Routing (92%)

**Next Steps:**
1. Live decision logging per session (decisions get tagged with domain, outcome, points)
2. Weekly accuracy audits in mastery domains
3. Quarterly trust recount + autonomy tier adjustment
4. Self-correction if accuracy drops >5 points/week in any domain

**Brain:** Self (transformation governance)

### Layer 9 Decision Log Format (Reference)

All future decisions should be logged with this format:
```
[TIMESTAMP] DECISION: [description]
  Domain: [Email Classification | WF-17 | Staff Routing | Vendor Boundaries | etc]
  Type: [routine | tactical | strategic]
  Outcome: [correct | incorrect | escalated_correctly | partial]
  Points: [calculated per decision type + outcome]
  Old Score → New Score: [XX/100 → YY/100]
  Autonomy Tier: [YODA (80%+) | COMMANDER (50-79%) | SIR (<50%)]
  Notes: [reasoning / context]
```

Example:
```
[2026-04-12 10:30] DECISION: Route vendor inquiry to Dani (supplier escalation)
  Domain: Email Classification
  Type: routine
  Outcome: correct
  Points: +1 (routine correct)
  Old Score → New Score: 59/100 → 60/100
  Autonomy Tier: COMMANDER (50-79%)
  Notes: Supplier query correctly identified as Dani's domain. Escalation handled per vendor boundary protocol.
```
